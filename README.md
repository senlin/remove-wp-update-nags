## Description

> GDPR-compliant: does not collect any user data

If you have decided to stay on WordPress version 4.9.x instead of joining the block-craze going on in WP-circles, then you will quickly get tired of the constant nags all over the WordPress Dashboard.

The Remove WP Update Nags plugin takes care of the following nags:

* it removes the main nag that shows at the top of every page
* it removes the Updates submenu of the main Dashboard sidebar menu; plugins and themes updates can be seen on their resp. pages
* it adjusts the admin footer by simply showing the current version of the WP install instead of the line with a link

The plugin also adds a few filters to make sure the site only receive minor (point release) updates. In other words the auto update to 4.9.x is allowed, but the auto update to 5.x.x is not.

There are no settings, simply install and be free from update nags.

We support this plugin exclusively through [Github](https://github.com/senlin/remove-wp-update-nags/issues). Therefore, if you have any questions, need help and/or want to make a feature request, please open an issue here. You can also browse through open and closed issues to find what you are looking for and perhaps even help others.

Thanks for your understanding and cooperation.
